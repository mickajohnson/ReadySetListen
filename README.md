# ReadySetListen

This is a somewhat rough Next.js port of an app I built several years ago in Angular to generate a Spotify playlist based on either a recent concert from the artist of a user's choice or a 'typical' concert from that artist.

Uses APIs from MusicBrainz, Setlist.fm, and Spotify.
Built by Mick Johnson using Next.js
